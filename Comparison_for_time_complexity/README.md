Great work, Ahmed! Here's a well-formatted `README.md` file that includes both of your pseudocode solutions along with a brief explanation of their logic and performance difference.

# Array Multiplication Performance Comparison

## Overview

This project compares two different approaches to compute cumulative products of a random integer array. The objective is to demonstrate the difference in execution time between a **direct multiplication approach** and an **optimized cumulative product approach**.

## Problem Statement

Given an array **A** of size `N = 1000` filled with random integers between 1 and 50, generate another array **B** such that:

- **B[i]** = A[0] _ A[1] _ ... \* A[i]

This process is performed using two solutions:

1. **Solution 1**: Direct multiplication at every index (O(N¬≤) time complexity)
2. **Solution 2**: Optimized approach using cumulative product (O(N) time complexity)

## üîÅ Solution 1: Direct Multiplication

### Pseudocode ‚Äì High-Level
```

MODULE SOLUTIONS
BEGIN MAIN
DECLARE A[N], B[N]
CALL generateRandomArray1(A, N)
start1 = clock()
CALL calculateArrayB_Direct1(A, B, N)
end1 = clock()
time_taken1 = (end1 - start1) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC
PRINT time_taken1
CALL printArray1(B, N)
END MAIN

```

### Low-Level Functions
- `generateRandomArray1`: Fills array A with random values between 1 and 50.
- `calculateArrayB_Direct1`: For each B[i], multiply all A[0] to A[i].
- `printArray1`: Prints all values in array B.

### Complexity
- **Time**: O(N¬≤)
- **Space**: O(N)

## ‚ö° Solution 2: Optimized Multiplication

### Pseudocode ‚Äì High-Level
```

BEGIN MAIN
DECLARE A[SIZE], B[SIZE]
CALL generateRandomArray2(A, SIZE)
start_time = CURRENT_TIME()
CALL calculateArrayB_Optimized2(A, B, SIZE)
end_time = CURRENT_TIME()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
PRINT execution_time
CALL printArray2(B, SIZE)
END MAIN

````

### Low-Level Functions
- `generateRandomArray2`: Same as in Solution 1.
- `calculateArrayB_Optimized2`: Uses previous B[i-1] * A[i] to calculate B[i].
- `printArray2`: Prints all values in array B.

### Complexity
- **Time**: O(N)
- **Space**: O(N)

## üß™ Comparison

| Metric            | Solution 1          | Solution 2          |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Time Complexity    | O(N¬≤)               | O(N)                |
| Performance        | Slower (Nested Loop)| Faster (Single Loop)|
| Use Case           | Educational Purpose | Real-world Systems  |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation & Execution (C Language)

```bash
gcc -o array_multiplication main.c
./array_multiplication
````

Ensure you have a `main.c` with both solutions implemented and `time.h` included for performance measurement.

---

## üìå Note

Both solutions assume that the product of array elements will not exceed the maximum range of integers. For real-world systems, consider using `long long` or `BigInt` equivalents to avoid overflow.
