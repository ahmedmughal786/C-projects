This C program manages and processes recycling data for students at Prince Gilagila Primary SchoolIt reads collection data from a file, calculates payments based on the number of plastic and glass bottles collected, allows users to query individual student data, and saves the processed information to a CSV file

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.c` Contains the `main` function and handles user interaction.
- `coins.txt` Input file containing raw collection dat.
- `payments.csv` Output file where processed payment data is save.

## 🛠️ Features

- \*_Data Export_: Writes the aggregated data to `payments.csv` upon exitig.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gc`)
- A terminal or command prmpt

### Compilation

To compile the program, ru:



````bash
gcc main.c employee.c -o recycling_program
``


### Execution

To execute the program, ru:


```bash
./recycling_program
``


## 🧪 Sample Input (`coins.tx`)


```text
Alice 10 5
Bob 7 3
Alice 4 2
Charlie 5 0```


## 📤 Sample Output (`payments.cv`)


```csv
Alice,14,7,1.75
Bob,7,3,0.95
Charlie,5,0,0.2
````

## 🔍 Usage

Upon running the program:

1. The program reads data from `coin.txt.
2. It displays menu:
   - **Enter Child Nme**: Prompts for a student's name and displays their total bottles collected and pyment.
   - **Eit**: Saves all data to `payments.csv` and exits the pogram.

## 📌 Ntes

- Ensure that `coins.txt` is present in the same directory as the exeutale.
- The program handles multiple entries for the same student by aggregating ther dta.
- Payments are calculated using the ormul:

  

```c
